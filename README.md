# React Patterns and Snippets

This folder contains a collection of useful React patterns, components, and hooks that Iâ€™ve come across and experimented with while learning and building projects.  
The goal is to create a reference library of common solutions and design approaches that I can reuse and improve over time.

<!-- ## ðŸ”§ Included Patterns

| File Name                           | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `form-data-to-object.jsx`           | Converts HTML form input into a structured JavaScript object â€” useful for form handling.                 |
| `component-composition-pattern.jsx` | Demonstrates advanced component composition for better reusability and flexibility.                      |
| `portal-with-imperative-handle.jsx` | Combines `ReactDOM.createPortal` with `useImperativeHandle` to expose functions to the parent component. |
| `input-with-ref.jsx`                | Shows how to use `useRef` to control focus and access input values directly.                             |
| `context-api-usage.jsx`             | A simple example of using Reactâ€™s Context API for state sharing across components.                       |
| `useReducer-pattern.jsx`            | Demonstrates state management using `useReducer` hook, great for handling complex component logic.       |

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All files are standalone JSX examples.
- Each pattern is meant to be readable and modifiable.
- More patterns will be added and refined over time.

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas for the Future

- Add inline comments or separate documentation for each snippet
- Refactor patterns into reusable modules or hooks
- Create a demo app to showcase patterns in action

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This is not a production-ready library.  
It's a learning and reference repository to help deepen my understanding of React and its ecosystem.
