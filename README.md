# React Patterns and Snippets

This folder contains a collection of useful React patterns, components, and hooks that Iâ€™ve come across and experimented with while learning and building projects.  
The goal is to create a reference library of common solutions and design approaches that I can reuse and improve over time.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- All files are standalone JSX examples.
- Each pattern is meant to be readable and modifiable.
- More patterns will be added and refined over time.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas for the Future

- Add inline comments or separate documentation for each snippet
- Refactor patterns into reusable modules or hooks
- Create a demo app to showcase patterns in action

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This is not a production-ready library.  
It's a learning and reference repository to help deepen my understanding of React and its ecosystem.
